"""Prompt builders for pet generation.

Two prompt shapes: a *base* prompt (prompt-only, produces the canonical look the
user picks between) and per-*state* *row* prompts (grounded on the chosen base,
produce one horizontal strip of N poses). Prompts stay concise and
sprite-production oriented; the identity lock and "one transparent row" framing
matter more than flowery description.

We generate the full petdex/Codex nine-state set (see
:data:`agent.pet.generate.atlas.ROW_SPECS`) so a hatched pet is a valid
``petdex submit`` spritesheet.

# What each petdex/Codex state should depict (kept short — these go straight into
# the row prompt). Phrased to avoid the common sprite-gen failure modes (detached
# effects, motion lines, shadows). Critical distinction: ``running`` is the
# *working* state (in place), while ``running-right`` / ``running-left`` are the
# actual directional walk/run cycles.
